# Underpin Mu Plugin Boilerplate

This repository contains the bare-minimum needed to quickly set up and install Underpin on a WordPress website. This is _not_ the only way to install Underpin, but if you are building a custom website that has multiple plugins and themes that will use Underpin, this is the best way to go about it.

For more information on Underpin, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/Underpin-WP/underpin).
